This is where I'm putting various things I used to learn how to use three.js

Currently I used a tutorial by necsoft hosted on medium.com to get this going at first
I ended up deviating from that tutorial and adding lights, changing geometries, and changing shading styles. 

Did some testing, spheres are out, sprites are in.
