Leaflet Templete

Used the leaflet Choropleth map tutorial as a base and modified until we got this template.

The goal of this template is to provide a quick and easy to modify base for future visualizations. 

Sources used: Leaflet, provider, Open Data BR, EBRGIS Open Data, and whatever Stackexchange articles I read but forgot to mention
